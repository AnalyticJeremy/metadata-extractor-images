To complete your collection I also include the image SIMG0017.jpg from a "Traveler SX330Z". Traveler is a product brand used by the german foodstore chain ALDI for special offerings. The camera itself is identical to the Jenoptik JENDIGITAL JD 3300 z3 which ultimately seems to be the Skanhex SX330z.
