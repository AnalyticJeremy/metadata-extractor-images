Deciphering makernote tags...

Nikon Browser identifies the lens as "18-70mm F/3.5-4.5 G" which is identical to metadata extractor, except for the G.  This must be coming from another tag...

Nikon Browser calls the metering mode "Multi-Pattern", whereas metadata extractor calls it "Multi-segment".

Nikon Browser has "Optimize Image:" as a tag (though I've only seen it blank).  Perhaps this maps to an unknown tag?

Note that the camera implements image protection (locking images) via the file's 'readonly' attribute.  Similarly image hiding uses the 'hidden' attribute.

more unknown tag values:

0x0016 = 0 0 49163 53255
0x0017 = 
0x0018 = 
0x0019 = 0
0x00a0 = NO= 00002539        
0x00a2 = 1564851
0x00a3 = 0
0x00a7 = 5062
0x00aa = NORMAL (Saturation)
0x00ab = AUTO (Sharpening)


TODO:
- investigate TAG_NIKON_TYPE3_UNKNOWN_10 with a few more images to determine it's meaning (seen NATURAL, SPEEDLIGHT...)
